# Checko
---------------

An iOS TODO app specially done for procastinators, shame will follow you forever if the task is not finished in time. Tasks cannot be deleted, there's a limited amount of tasks you can add, and you only have 24 hours to complete them. Developed with UIKit. 

*I'm the Reminder of Shame :tm: and I'm here to make you feel miserable every day. What did you accomplish last day? I'm expecting you to at least feel a little embarrassed if you didn't do anything. And that's precisely my food: your suffering.*
